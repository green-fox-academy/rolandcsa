                    <dt>Logic Gate</dt>
                    <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, 
                        it performs a logical operation on one or more binary 
                        inputs and produces a single binary output.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>ASCII</dt>        
                    <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
                        Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a 
                        character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>    

                    <dt>Random-access memory</dt>
                    <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program 
                        instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. 
                        Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of 
                        the physical location of data inside the memory.</dd>    

                    <dt>Programming language</dt>
                    <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce 
                        various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and
                         can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</dd>    

                    <dt>Domain Name System</dt>
                    <dd>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other 
                        resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various 
                        information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</dd>

                    <dd>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information 
                        systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 
                        It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</dd>
